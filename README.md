# WeVoteServer

This WeVoteServer repository contains a Python/Django-powered API server. 
WeVoteServer powers the We Vote front-end applications:

 * [Node/React/Flux WebApp mobile website](https://github.com/wevote/WebApp)
 
 * [ioS App](https://github.com/wevote/iOSApp)
 
 * (Android coming soon)

You can see our current wireframe mockup for a San Francisco ballot here:

## Installing Python/Django API Server

These are the models and controllers that power the API Endpoints used by the front end applications. 
We recommend you install this first. 

Initial installation instructions for the 
[Python/Django API server can be found here](README_API_INSTALL.md).
